Barstool Sports has been a household name to college students in the Northeast for the past six or seven years.  In the past year, specifically with strategic investment from The Chernin Group this presence has started to expand on to the national stage.  In some capacity most of the 18-34 age bracket has had some exposure to Barstool in the last six months.  Whether it's "Saturday with the Boys", "Pardon My Take" or "the Rundown" on Comedy Central the brand has started to spread and resonate across the country.

To most long time Stoolies (what Barstool calls their readers) it is not hard to understand why Barstool resonates.  In an era where trust in media is at an all time low and many new media models focus on technology and virality, Barstool has always gone against the grain  It's tech, until recently was at best a detriment and probably better described as a disaster.  The site has cultivated unique personalitys that are authentic, honest and speak to many issues that are outside the realm of a sports media complex that is increasingly hollow and out of touch.

As a Stoolie myself, I thought it would be interesting to dig into the facebook side of the data and try to understand how Barstool has evolved.

###Change in the usage of facebook as a platform

The data reaches back five years to 2013 (when Barstool started to become increasingly active on Facebook).  Breaking down the year by year data, the impact of Chernin is remarkable.  Barstool became cognizant of the need for a facebook strategy (or at least the leverage that facebook provides to reach new audiences), in particular late in 2015 with the number of posts seeing a big uptick.

###Changes in popularity

There are two major inflection points in Barstool's history on facebook.

The first comes during the Boston Marathon bombings.  Barstool made a major leap with content telling the story, raising money and rallying Boston during the tragedy.  Much of the audience they gained during April 2013 stayed in their numbers throughout the year.  It was a great initial indicator of the power of their engagement.  For a New England based cause their appeal was unique.

They carried similar numbers through much of 2014 and 2015.  In November of 2015, they saw their second major uptick.  The cause is much more ambiguous but both the consistentcy with median share numbers and outsized average share numbers suggest that something changed.

These numbers have remained fairly consistent throughout 2016 and early 2017.

###change in types of content

Since the Chernin acquisition the focus on video is clear to anybody paying attention.  In 2015 video accounted for 1.1% of all posts.  In 2016 post Chernin that number jumped to 8.5%.  So far in 2017 it is slighty above 25%.

Their reasoning for increasing video appears obvious.  Both the median share rate and average share rate are significantly higher for videos than links.

There is a clear change in what resonates.  In 2013, 2014 and 2015 the common theme of the most shared posts was they were New England centric (Boston Marathon, Brady, Belichick, Goodell, other Boston teams), like this or this.  As Barstool has evolved in both geographic and content scope this has changed drastically.  The most shared post in 2016 was a dog chasing a goose around a rock (link) or a video of Rick Flair at a restaurant.
