title: "Toronto's Toronto's $332,550 Parking Spot"
date: 2016-03-10

Yesterday, the City of Toronto released their 2015 parking ticket data.  The dataset contains information on every parking ticket issued in the city in 2015.  Inspiried by the fantastic I Quant NY blog, I started exploring the data to see if I could uncover any interesting trends or nuggets of information.

Toronto's most expensive parking ticket is $450.  There are several infractions that are deemed worthy of that hefty price tag, one of which is "Stand On Street Accessible No Permit".  

In 2014, 2985 of these tickets were handed out with almost a quarter of them coming from one location, 410 College St.  At 739 tickets, that is a little over 2 tickets a day.  With each ticket costing $450 a pop, this 410 College St spot generated $332,550 in revenue for the city, just in 2014.
