Yesterday, the City of Toronto released their 2015 parking ticket dataset detailing raw information on every parking ticket issued last year.  Inspiried by the fantastic <a href="http://iquantny.tumblr.com/">I Quant NY blog</a>, I started exploring the data to hopefully uncover some interesting trends.  I also used comparable 2013 and 2014 datasets to find year over year consistencies.

An interesting starting point when looking at this data is examining Toronto's most expensive parking ticket, $450.  There are several infractions that are deemed worthy of the hefty price tag, usually some variation of illegally parking in a handicapped area.  Some of the frequent addresses are expected: 555 Rexdale Blvd (Woodbine), 1090 Don Mills Rd (Shops at Don Mills) and 3401 Dufferin St (Yorkdale).  All have large parking areas where you could envision drivers trying to get away with parking in handicapped spots.  That said, the most fined locations are usually more obscure, usually in spots that have consistently flummoxed Toronto drivers.

For the last three years 410 College St has been the undisputed king of max fine parking tickets, doubling any other Toronto address.  In the google streetview image below (in which a likely victim is parked in the spot), the signage appears pretty clear but the presence of a handicapped spot is likely the issue. 

## 410 College St (Across the street)

###  2015 796 tickets issued for $358,200 

### 2014: 893 tickets issued for $401,850

### 2013: 647 tickets issued for $291,150

There is a significant drop off in tickets, but a max ticket per day at 18 Grenville St is still a nice revenue generator for City Hall.  Likely another case of an odd place for a handicapped designitation to be.  

## 18 Grenville St 

### 2015: 342 tickets issued for $153,900

### 2014: 328 tickets issued for $147,600

### 2013: 400 tickets issued for $180,000

Another victim pictured in the google street view image.  This is the exit on the eastside of the Manulife center.  The discrete underground nature of the exit likely throws people off. 

## 35 Balmuto St (Across the street)

### 2015: 326 tickets issued for $146,700

### 2014: 253 tickets issued for $113,850

### 2013: 257 tickets issued for $115,650

The last of Toronto's prolific max fine spots, is on Murray St just west of Mount Sinai hospital.

## 60 Murray St

### 2015: 287 tickets issued for $129,150

### 2014: 346 tickets issued for $155,700.

### 2013: 315 tickets issued for $141,750
