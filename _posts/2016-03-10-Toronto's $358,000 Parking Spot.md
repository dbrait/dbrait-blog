Yesterday, the City of Toronto released their 2015 parking ticket dataset detailing raw information on every parking ticket issued last year.  Inspiried by the fantastic <a href="http://iquantny.tumblr.com/">I Quant NY blog</a>, I started exploring the data to hopefully uncover some interesting trends.  I also used comparable 2013 and 2014 datasets to find year over year consistencies.

An interesting starting point when looking at this data is examining Toronto's most expensive parking ticket, $450.  There are several infractions that are deemed worthy of the hefty price tag, usually some variation of illegally parking in a handicapped area.  Some of the frequent addresses are expected: 555 Rexdale Blvd (Woodbine), 1090 Don Mills Rd (Shops at Don Mills) and 3401 Dufferin St (Yorkdale).  All have large parking areas where you could envision drivers trying to get away with parking in handicapped spots.  That said, the most fined locations are more obscure spots that have consistently flummoxed Toronto drivers.

For the last three years 410 College St has been the undisputed king of max fine parking tickets, doubling any other Toronto address.  In the google streetview image below (in which a likely victim is parked in the spot), the signage appears pretty clear but the presence of a handicapped spot is likely the issue.  In 2015 alone **796 tickets** were issued at 410 College St for a total of **$358,200**.  This is not a one year abberation, as the spot generated **$401,850** in 2014 and **$291,150** in 2013.

No other address in Toronto is as consistent a revenue producer as 410 College St, but there are several other max spots that seem to be a lock every year for $100,000+ in city revenue.  18 Grenville St another case of an odd place for a handicapped designitation, that averages a max ticket a day.  In 2015 the city issued **342 tickets for $153,900** in fines.  Each of the last three years fines at 18 Grenville have topped **$145,000**

Another google street view image with a likely victim in the still shot.  This is across the street from 35 Balmuto just outside an Manulife Center eastside exit.  This has topped $100,000 in fines the last three years with 2015 seeing **326 tickets** for **$146,700**.

The last of Toronto's prolific max fine spots, is 60 Murray St just west of Mount Sinai hospital.  In 2015 this spot had **287 tickets issued for $129,150** in fines.  That was its lowest total the last three years, topping $140,000 in both 2013 and 2014.
