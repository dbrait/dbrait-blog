Yesterday, the City of Toronto released their 2015 parking ticket data which contains information on every ticket last year in the city.  Inspiried by the fantastic <a href="http://iquantny.tumblr.com/">I Quant NY blog</a>, I started exploring the data to see if I could uncover any interesting trends.  I used the 2013 and 2014 datasets to ensure that the findings were not aberrations.

Toronto's most expensive parking ticket is $450.  There are several infractions that are deemed worthy of that hefty price tag, most of which are some variation of parking in a handicapped area.  Some of the most frequent addresses are what you would expect: 555 Rexdale Blvd (Woodbine), 1090 Don Mills Rd (Shops at Don Mills) and 3401 Dufferin St (Yorkdale).    

However, the most ticketed areas are in unlikely places, often claiming victims due to confusing locations or marking.  

For the last three years 410 College St has been the undisputed king of max fine parking tickets, doubling any other Toronto address.  In the google streetview image below (in which a likely victim is parked in the spot), the signage appears pretty clear but the presence of a handicapped spot is likely the issue.

There is a significant drop off in tickets, but a max ticket per day at 18 Grenville St is still a nice revenue generator for city hall.  Likely another case of an odd place for a handicapped designitation to be.  

## 18 Grenville St

### 2014: 328 tickets issued for $147,600
