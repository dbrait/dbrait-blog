The city of Toronto's most expensive parking ticket is $450.  There are several infractions that are deemed worthy of that hefty price tag, one of which is "Stand On Street Accessible No Permit".  In 2014, 2985 of these tickets were handed out with almost a quarter of them coming from one location, 410 College St.  At 739 tickets, that is a little over 2 tickets a day.  With each ticket costing $450 a pop, this 410 College St spot generated $332,550 in revenue for the city, just in 2014.  410 College St has been a consistent cash cow for City Hall, bringing in x in 2013, y in 2012, and z in 2011.  Even in the google streetview there appears to be a car that is illegally parked.

This offence tends to create some confusion as there are several other addresses that are among the cities highest grossing locations.
