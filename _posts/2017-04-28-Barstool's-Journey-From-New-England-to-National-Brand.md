Ask any long time Barstool reader (Stoolie) about the company's success and they will have no problem explaining why Barstool resonates.  The site has cultivated unique personalitys that are authentic, honest and speak to many issues outside the realm of an increasingly out of touch sports media and entertainment complex.  Most new media companies have focused on technology and virality, often at the expense of content. Barstool went against the grain.  Because of that they have built a bond with their fans that does not exist anywhere else.

Since the start of the decade, Barstool Sports has been a household name in the Northeast.  With strategic investment from The Chernin Group this presence has started to expand on to the national stage. Sub brands like "Saturday with the Boys" and "Pardon My Take" illustrate the power Barstool has to reach large young audiences on a national scale.

Like any company that is different, Barstool's business breeds interest from incumbents and industry observers. For the high level strategic overview, the  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RichardDeitsch/posts/1328831270511252">Richard Deistch podcast with Erica Nardini</a> (the new CEO) is particularly good.  For an interesting thesis on what barstool is trying to become, Anthony Pomliano is a <a href="https://medium.com/@apompliano/dave-portnoy-and-barstool-sports-secret-billion-dollar-plan-bb002ba429a7">great read.  

It is clear to anybody who has followed Barstool that they have shifted.  As a Stoolie myself, I decided to dig into their Facebook data and to see how Barstool has evolved.

##Change in Facebook Usage

I scraped data from the main barstoolsports facebook page reaching back five years to 2013 (when Barstool started to become increasingly active on Facebook).  Barstool became cognizant of the need for a Facebook strategy (or at least the leverage that facebook provides to reach new audiences), late in 2014 with the number of posts seeing a big uptick.

##Changes in popularity

The data makes it clear that there are two major inflection points in Barstool's popularity, and another one currently developing.

The first comes during the Boston Marathon bombings.  Barstool made a major leap by telling the story, raising money and rallying Boston.  Their biggest posts in 2013 were J<a href="https://www.facebook.com/barstoolsports/photos/a.352575592501.188647.348156187501/10151640240762502/?type=3&theater">Jeff Bauman delivering Sydney Corcoran her 18th birtday present</a> and the  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/barstoolsports/photos/a.352575592501.188647.348156187501/10151635290102502/?type=3&theater">escort for Sean Collier</a> who was the MIT officer killed the day after the bombings.  Much of the audience they gained during April 2013 stayed in their numbers throughout the year.  It was a great initial indicator of the power of their engagement.

Barstool carried similar numbers through much of 2014 and 2015.  In November of 2015, they saw their second major uptick.  The cause is much more ambiguous, perhaps it was the result of a change in strategy.

In 2013, 2014 and 2015 the common theme in viral posts was New England centric (Boston Marathon, Boston teams, Brady, Goodell, etc).  As Barstool evolved in both geographic and content scope this changed drastically.  Their core content stayed similar but their most shared posts since late 2015, range from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/barstoolsports/videos/10153832862622502/">Big Cat watching the Aaron Rodgers Hail Mary with Superfan and Detroit Don</a>, to various Bills Mafia videos, to the standard viral videos like  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/barstoolsports/videos/10154656453582502/">a dog chasing a goose around a rock</a> or a video of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/barstoolsports/videos/10154574992232502/">Rick Flair at a restaurant.</a>

The numbers remained fairly consistent throughout 2016 and early 2017 despite the Chernin Acquisition at the start of the year and the move into the New York office in September.

The interesting trend to watch is the recent jump this month (April).  Numbers have risen significantly and it will definitely be worth tracking to see if that is the start of a new level of growth.

The Chernin acquistion has brought all sorts of smaller changes in promotion and types of content that I will hopefully dive into in a later post.  For now, I thought this was an interesting look into how Barstool has grown over the past five years.
