The City of Toronto's <a href="http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=83a7c060155d0310VgnVCM1000003dd60f89RCRD&vgnextchannel=bee6e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD">open data portal</a> has a frequently updated dataset with detailed information on all the licences issued in the city.  I thought it would be interesting to look at the city's coffee shops and examine the current landscape and how things have changed over the last 15 years.  


## Tim Hortons
Tim Horton's has always been the undisputed king of coffee in Toronto as evidenced by the numbers. <img src="img/Tims Graph.png">  For the last fifteen years they have had a dominating presence across the city.  There is a dense concentration of stores in downtown and the rest of the map is close to evenly distributed, with Tim's locations popping up near most major intersections. <img src="img/Tims Current.png">


## Starbucks
The last decade's most notable development is the aggressive expansion of Starbucks. <img src="img/Starbucks Graph.png">  Tim's can still claim superior breadth throughout the city.  However, along the subway lines, in the downtown core, and in Toronto's upscale neighbourhoods, Starbucks has caught and arguably surpassed Tim Hortons.<img src="img/Starbucks Current.png">  Comparing the current map, to maps from 2006 and 2011 you can see Starbucks has doubled down on their core demographic, leaving no wealthy area of the city uncovered. <img src="img/Starbucks Five Years.png"> <img src="img/Starbucks Ten Years.png">


## Upscale Mini Chains
Second Cup has long been Toronto's third biggest coffee chain growing incrementally with the city's population. <img src="img/Second Cup Graph.png"> Their strategy lies somewhere in between Tim's and Starbucks, as they predominantly cater to a downtown/commuter base, but have also expanded into other areas. <img src="img/Second Cup Current.png">

Alongside the rise of Starbucks, the last decade has seen the proliferation of niche coffee chains.  Aroma Espresso Bar is a great example, five years ago it barely existed, now they are big enough to register as a portion of the market.<img src="img/Aroma Graph.png">  On a smaller scale, they have followed the same pattern as Starbucks, scattering locations downtown and along the subway. <img src="img/Aroma Current.png"> 


## Losing Market Share
Two chains have struggled over the last decade and lost significant market share.  Coffee Time has declined each of the last five years. <img src="img/Coffee Time Graph.png"> <img src="img/Coffee Time Current.png">  Timothy's has has been the biggest loser in upscale locations as niche brands and Starbucks have taken over. <img src="img/Timothys Graph.png"> <img src="img/Timothys Current.png">


## Other Competitors
All of this does not consider the rise of the independent coffee shop, which in certain neighborhoods is a significant portion of the market.  It also does not include places like McDonald's, which in certain parts of the city is likely Tim Horton's biggest competitor.
