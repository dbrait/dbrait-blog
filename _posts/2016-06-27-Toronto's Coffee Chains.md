The City of Toronto's <a href="http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=83a7c060155d0310VgnVCM1000003dd60f89RCRD&vgnextchannel=bee6e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD">open data portal</a> has a frequently updated dataset with detailed information on all the licences issued in the city.  I thought it would be interesting to look at the city's coffee shops and examine the current landscape and how things have changed over the last 15 years.  

## Tim Hortons
Tim Horton's has always been the undisputed king of coffee in Toronto and this trend is self evident when looking at the numbers. <img src="img/Tims Graph.png">  For the last fifteen years they have had a dominating presence across the city.  There is a dense concentration of stores in downtown and the rest of the map is close to evenly distributed, with Tim's locations popping up near most major intersections. <img src="img/Tims Current.png">

## Starbucks
The last decade's most notable development is the aggressive expansion of Starbucks. <img src="img/Starbucks Graph.png">  Tim's can still claim superior breadth throughout the city.  However, along the subway lines, in the downtown core, and in Toronto's upscale neighbourhoods, Starbucks has caught and arguably surpassed Tim Hortons.<img src="img/Starbucks Current.png">  Comparing the current map, to maps from 2006 and 2011 you can see Starbucks has doubled down on their core demographic, leaving no wealthy area of the city uncovered. <img src="img/Starbucks Five Years.png"> <img src="img/Starbucks Ten Years.png">

## Upscale Mini Chains
Alongside the rise of Starbucks, the last decade has seen the proliferation of niche coffee chains.  Ten years ago Aroma and La Prep barely existed, now they scatter the map both downtown and at many main subway locations. <img src="img/La Prep Graph.png"> <img src="img/Aroma Graph.png"> <img src="img/La Prep Current.png"> <img src="img/Aroma Current.png"> Second Cup has grown incrementally focusing on a similar demographic. <img src="img/Second Cup Graph.png"> <img src="img/Second Cup Current.png">

## Losing Market Share
Two chains have really lost significant market share.  Coffee Time has declined each of the last five years. <img src="img/Coffee Time Graph.png"> <img src="img/Coffee Time Current.png">  Timothy's has lost a ton of market share in the more upscale locations as niche brands and Starbucks have taken over. <img src="img/Timothys Graph.png"> <img src="img/Timothys Current.png">

## Other Competitors
All of this does not consider the rise of the independent coffee shop, which in certain neighborhoods is a significant portion of the market.  It also does not include places like McDonald's, which in certain parts of the city is likely Tim Horton's biggest competitor.
