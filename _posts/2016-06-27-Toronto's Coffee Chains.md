The City of Toronto's <a href="http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=83a7c060155d0310VgnVCM1000003dd60f89RCRD&vgnextchannel=bee6e03bb8d1e310VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD">open data portal</a> has a frequently updated dataset with detailed information on all the licences issued in the city.  I thought it would be interesting to look at the city's coffee shops and examine the current landscape and how things have changed over the last 15 years.  

## Tim Hortons
Tim Horton's has always been the undisputed king of coffee in Canada and this trend is self evident when looking at the numbers and maps. <img src="img/Tims Current.png"> For the last fifteen years they have had a dominating presence in Toronto, both downtown and in the near suburbs.  There is a dense concentration of stores in downtown and the rest of the map is close to evenly distributed, with Tim's locations popping up near most major intersections.  Through the years the overarching theme has stayed the same, with Tim's growing incrementally every five years, likely inline with the city's growth.

## Starbucks
The last decade's most notable development is the aggressive expansion of Starbucks. <img src="img/Starbucks Graph.png">  Tim's can still claim superior breadth throughout the city.  However, along the subway lines, in the downtown core and in Toronto's wealthy enclaves Starbucks has caught and arguably surpassed Tim Hortons.<img src="img/Starbucks Current.png">  Total stores have gone from X TO Y since 2006, and as you can see Starbucks has seemingly doubled down on their core demographic, leaving no wealthy area of the city uncovered.

## Upscale Mini Chains
The last twenty years the rise of the upscale coffee chain.  Likely following the example of Starbucks, several mini chains have expanded in a similar way (downtown and along subway lines).  Ten years ago Aroma and La Prep barely existed, now they scatter the map both downtown and at many main subway locations. <img src="img/La Prep Graph.png"> <img src="img/Aroma Graph.png"> <img src="img/La Prep Current.png"> <img src="img/Aroma Current.png"> Second Cup has grown incrementally focusing on a similar demographic. <img src="img/Second Cup Graph.png"> <img src="img/Second Cup Current.png">

## Losing Market Share
Two chains seem to have really lost significant market share.  Coffee Time has lost significant ground every five years. <img src="img/Coffee Time Graph.png"> <img src="img/Coffee Time Current.png">  Timothy's has lost a ton of market share in the more upscale locations as niche brands and Starbucks have taken over. <img src="img/Timothys Graph.png"> <img src="img/Timothys Current.png">

## Other Competitors
All of this does not consider the rise of the independent coffee shop, which ancedotally seems like it has never been bigger.  Especially in certain downtown neighborhoods (Queen West, the Annex, Leslieville, etc) this is likely a large portion of the market.  It also does not include places like McDonald's, which with their location has likey been a significant headwind for Coffee Time and in certain parts of the city is likely Tim Horton's biggest competitor.
